      <p>
        Along with Matthew, Liza and Jessie, it is my job to ensure you leave CSSI with the confidence and skills
        you need to take on the world! I studied Education at Johns Hopkins University
        and then taught with Teach for America in Baltimore City. I just moved  to the best city in the world- San Francisco,
        and have enjoyed every second of being back home.
        Can't wait for CSSI MTV!
